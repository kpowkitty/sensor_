# Coding for Conservation
## Micro:bit program for tracking light and temperature in native bee hives
### Used in combination with [Logger](https://github.com/kpowkitty/logger_)

#### About
[Planet Bee Foundation](https://www.planetbee.org/) is programming [BBC Micro:bits](https://microbit.org/) with [Microsoft's Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) in order to bring conservation efforts to student's classrooms across America!
This program, __a WIP__, is being designed in combination with a Sensor script, so there will be one Micro:bit on the native bee home collecting the datapoints (the "Sensor"), and another Micro:bit within its bluetooth range that stores the data away from the nest, so the user can safely retrieve it without disturbing the home (the "Logger").
